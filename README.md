# Code_Pieces
Some reusable code from Codewars, HackerRank and other tasks and challenges.

Sometimes I find myself in situations where a previous code or program would provide the perfect solution... That's where these code pieces come in. They are also fruitful when creating a Frankenstein-esque software that benefits from some previously written code.

Although I know some of these might seem too basic, sometimes basic is just what you need.
